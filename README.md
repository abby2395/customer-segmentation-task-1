# CodeClause Internship Program: Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the CodeClause Internship Program. The objective is to analyze customer segmentation using a provided dataset to identify purchase behavior patterns through K-means clustering.

## Project Description

In this task, we will:

1. **Load the Customer Segmentation Dataset:** Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
2. **Preprocess the Data:** Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for clustering.
3. **Apply K-means Clustering:** Implement the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.
4. **Analyze Clusters:** Interpret and analyze the resulting clusters to draw insights about different customer segments.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for interactive analysis)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis:**
   Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script and follow the steps to load, preprocess, and analyze the data using K-means clustering.

## Results

After running the analysis, you will have:

- Preprocessed customer data ready for clustering.
- Identified clusters of customers based on their purchase behavior.
- Insights and visualizations to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering for customer segmentation. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction by understanding different customer segments.
